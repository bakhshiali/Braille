# Braille
I impressed by Mr Braille’s works and as social responsibility, I couldn’t ignore the opportunity to learn Braille system. Here we are

I’d tried the code in Jupyter Notebook and got the results as :


In [2] : English2Braiile(‘hi, i am ali bakhshi.’)

Out[2]: ‘⠓⠊⠠⠀⠊⠀⠁⠍⠀⠁⠇⠊⠀⠃⠁⠅⠓⠎⠓⠊⠨’


In  [3]: Braille2English(‘⠓⠊⠠⠀⠊⠀⠁⠍⠀⠁⠇⠊⠀⠃⠁⠅⠓⠎⠓⠊⠨’)

Out[3]: ‘hi, i am ali bakhshi.’

#future developments :
1) improvement of characters
2) adding more languages, uni-codes
3) GUI design
4) TTS (Text to speech)
5) OCR (Optical character recognition)
6) STT (Speech to text)
7) Machine Learning algorithms (Better Predictions)
